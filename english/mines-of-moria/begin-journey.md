You are Frodo Baggins, Ring bearer and part of the Fellowship of the Ring.  You are tasked with the quest of taking the one Ring of Power to Mount Doom in Mordor and, by throwing it in the fires of lava, destroying it.  This is the only way the Ring can be destroyed, and the only way that the Dark Lord Sauron can be undone and defeated.

You have journeyed with your fellows from Rivendell where the quest was laid on you by the elders. Having travelled far, and denied an easier route over the mountains, you stand now before a great cliff face, cold and dark gray with the moon's light dimmed by cloud. At the cliff's base, a wide platform stretches windswept and desolate, untrodden for countless years. A dark pool of water fills much of the platform, its surface black and still. Far above, hidden in perpetual mist and cloud, climbs the Silvertine, ZirakZigil in the Dwarven tongue, one of the three great peaks that adorn Khazad-dum, the ancient home of Durin.

The Wizard Gandalf led you and your fellow Walkers to this place to make use of the Doors of Durin, the ancient west-facing entrance to the Mines, crafted as testament to the friendship that once existed between the Dwarves of Khazad-dum and Eldar of Hollin. Gandalf doubtless knows that, though the doors once stood open and unfettered, they were sealed following the fall of Hollin. Thus, Gandalf now examines the rock closely, running his hand along its smooth surface, struggling to find evidence left by its master crafters. As he grows frustrated, the clouds above begin to part and the moon's pale light illumines the dark stone. A silvery portal takes shape as the moonlight rests upon the rock. 

Thin threads of silver-white light, brighter than the moon it reflects, trace the ancient gate upwards then inwards from the base of the cliff face. Two high columns, connected by a shining arch, frame the door in gleaming light. Between these, two delicate trees, each topped with crescent moon, and a large star takes shape - the symbol of the fated House of Feanor. Near the arch of the doors, a hammer and anvil shines, surrounded by seven gleaming stars. Three characters of the tengwa script form: calma (C) for Celebrimbor in the top-left corner, ore (N) for Narvi in the top-right corner, and ando (D) for Durin at the center-bottom of the doors. Finally, from each end, the threads of light begin tracing thin letters of Sindarin script that adorn the arch before meeting in the middle of the arch. 

Gandalf reads the flowing, illumined inscription in its original Sindarin:
*"Ennyn Durin Aran Moria. Pedo Mellon a Minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin."*

Which he translates promptly for the party:
*"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."*
